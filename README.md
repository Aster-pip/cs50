Harvard's intro to computer science course.

# Excercises completed
## Pset1
1. [Hello](https://docs.cs50.net/2018/x/psets/1/hello/hello.html): print "hello, world."
2. [Mario (more comfortable)](https://docs.cs50.net/2018/x/psets/1/mario/more/mario.html): print hashtags in shapes that look like the pyramids in Mario.
3. [Credit](https://docs.cs50.net/2018/x/psets/1/credit/credit.html): check if given card numbers are valid.

## Pset2
1. [Caesar](https://docs.cs50.net/2018/x/psets/2/caesar/caesar.html): encoded a string with a Caesar cipher (shift letters by a given amount).
2. [Crack](https://docs.cs50.net/2018/x/psets/2/crack/crack.html): crack hashed passwords up to 5 characters long.

## Pset3 (2018)
1. [Music](https://docs.cs50.net/2018/x/psets/3/music/music.html) (from 2018 course): modify a file distribution to add functionality to output the frequency of musical notes (eg A4 = 440Hz).


##### Note at this point the course was updated from its 2018 to 2019 versions. The test scores for the above Psets was carried over, except for Music which isn't on the course anymore.

## Pset3 (2019)
1. [Whodunit](https://lab.cs50.io/cs50/labs/2019/x/whodunit/): modify the bytes of a bitmap image file to change the colour of red pixels to reveal a message hidden in the noise.
2. [Resize (more comfortable)](https://docs.cs50.net/2019/x/psets/3/resize/more/resize.html): modify the headers and pixels of a bitmap file to increase or decrease its size.
3. [Recover](https://docs.cs50.net/2019/x/psets/3/recover/recover.html): find 50 JPEG files on a memory card by searching for the starting bytes of JPEG images.

## Pset4
1. [Speller (trie implementation)](https://docs.cs50.net/2019/x/psets/4/speller/trie/speller.html): store the words of a dictionary in a trie and then search the trie to see if passed words are spelt right. Also created functions to recursively count the words in the trie and recursively free the memory used by it at the end.

## Pset5
1. [Homepage](https://docs.cs50.net/2019/x/psets/5/homepage/homepage.html): create a small website with 4 pages. (Please don't judge me on this, I thoroughly half arsed it and just the minimum requirements.)
